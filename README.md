Linear Regression From Scratch & Application
Overview
This project focuses on understanding and applying Linear Regression using real-world datasets.
The objective is to build strong foundations by learning:
- How linear regression works mathematically
- How data preprocessing affects model performance
- How predictions behave in real-world scenarios

This project is part of my Machine Learning learning journey, emphasizing **conceptual clarity + hands-on practice.

What I Learned
- Difference between regression and classification problems
- Linear regression equation and interpretation
- Cost function (Mean Squared Error)
- Gradient Descent intuition
- Effect of learning rate and iterations
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model evaluation using error metrics

 Dataset
- Real-world dataset (e.g. housing / life expectancy / numeric regression data)
- Multiple numerical features
- Missing values handled using:
- Mean / Median imputation
- Categorical values handled appropriately
- Dataset cleaned to avoid data leakage

Implementation Steps
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Removed duplicates and handled missing values
3. Selected relevant features
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated model performance
7. Tested model with unseen (realistic) data

Model Evaluation
- Used metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Observed that predictions may deviate due to:
  - Real-world noise
  - Limited historical data
  - External unseen factors
